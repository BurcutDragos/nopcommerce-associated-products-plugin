# Associated Products Plugin for nopCommerce

A nopCommerce widget plugin that displays a curated list of associated products on the storefront product page. Associations are configured per-product from the admin panel, with support for display order, store scope settings, and product visibility filters.

---

## Features

- **Admin card on product edit page** — manage associated products directly from the product editing page in the admin panel
- **Product search popup** — search and select products to associate using filters (category, manufacturer, store, vendor, product type)
- **Display order** — control the order in which associated products appear
- **Plugin configuration page** — set the maximum number of associated products to display, with per-store override support
- **Public storefront widget** — associated products are rendered at the bottom of the product detail page using the standard `_ProductBox` partial (image, name, price, add-to-cart)
- **Smart visibility filtering** — only shows products that are published, not deleted, visible individually, and accessible to the current customer (ACL + store mapping)
- **Caching** — results are cached and automatically invalidated on any create/update/delete operation
